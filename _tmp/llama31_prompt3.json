        "To create a clear, formally sound user story, let's break down the given review and extract the relevant information.\n\nFrom the review, we can identify the following:\n\n- **Type of User:** The user is an end-user of the Threads app, who has uploaded videos and expects a specific functionality from the app.\n- **Goal:** The user wants to see audio in the videos they have uploaded, as the voice is currently not working.\n- **Action Requested:** The user is asking for two additional features: \n  1. Increase in followers (implied to increase visibility)\n  2. Virality of their videos\n\nHowever, request for likes and follows can be split into two steps: one related to the core product requirement and another related to engagement which is a secondary concern.

        "Let's break down the review to extract a user story.\n\nThe review states \"Excited to see how this goes.\" This suggests that the reviewer is eager to use the app, indicating they are a potential user.\n\nHigh expectations from Meta implies that the reviewer expects a high-quality experience from the app.\n\nTherefore, the goal of the user story is to meet these high expectations.\n\nHere's the structured user story:\n\n\"\"\"USER STORY: As a new user with high expectations, I want to have a seamless and engaging experience using the Threads app, so that I can meet my expectations and have a positive perception of Meta's capabilities.\"\"\"\nLet me know if this meets your requirements.",

        "To create a user story from the given review, let's analyze it step by step. The user is mentioning that the \"thread follow feature\" is not useful to them because they can still see posts from accounts they don't follow on their feed.\n\n1. **Determine the type of user**: Based on the review, the type of user is likely an existing user of the Threads app. Therefore, this user has already downloaded and used the app and is now providing feedback.\n\n2. **Determine what the user wants to do**: The issue the user encounters is that following a thread doesn't limit them from seeing posts from accounts they aren't following directly in their feed. This implies that the user wants a mechanism where being in a thread doesn't overlap with their overall feed, essentially making each interaction (threads and feed) mutually exclusive or at least providing a clear distinction between content from accounts they're following versus not.\n\n3. **Determine the goal**: The goal here is to enhance the usefulness or functionality of the thread follow feature. The user believes that if threads were integrated in such a way that following a thread doesn\u2019t expose them to non-followed accounts in their main feed, the feature would be more useful.\n\n4. **Create the user story** using the provided template:\n\"**USER STORY:** As a [type of user], I want [to do something], so that [some goal is met].\"\n\nGiven the above analysis, the user story would be:\n\"As an existing user of the Threads app, I want to be able to exclusively see updates from threads I follow without seeing posts from accounts I\u2019m not following on my main feed, so that the thread follow feature is useful and more valuable to me.\"\n\nThis ensures that we capture the essence of the user's feedback in a clear and concise request for how to improve the app's functionality or user experience.",
        "To create a clear, formally sound user story based on the provided app review, let's break down the feedback into actionable requirements.\n\nFrom the review, we can extract the following concerns:\n\n1. The user wants to see their following content and related content on the home page.\n2. The user wants more content on the home page.\n3. The user wants an update to the privacy setting.\n4. The user wants an update to the translation setting.\n\nNow, let's classify the user type based on their feedback. Since they're expressing opinions about the app's functionality and wishing for improvements, we can classify them as a:\n\n**Power User**: A power user is someone who is familiar with the app and its features, uses it regularly, and provides feedback on how to make it better.\n\nNow, let's create the user story using the provided template:\n\n\"As a Power User, I want to customize the home page to display a feed of content from accounts I follow and similar content, and have more content options available, so that I can easily stay up-to-date with what's happening on the app and have a more personalized experience.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the other three points mentioned in the review. We can create additional user stories for each of these requirements:\n\n* User wants an update to the privacy setting:\n\"As a Power User, I want to easily access and control my privacy settings, including the ability to customize what information is shared with others, so that I can maintain control over my personal data and online presence.\"\n* User wants an update to the translation setting:\n\"As a Power User, I want to be able to easily switch between languages and translate content in the app, so that I can communicate with users who speak different languages and access content that may not be available in my native language.\"\n\nNow, let's put all the user stories together in a single piece of output:\n\n```sql\nUSER STORY: As a Power User, I want to customize the home page to display a feed of content from accounts I follow and similar content, and have more content options available, so that I can easily stay up-to-date with what's happening on the app and have a more personalized experience.\nUSER STORY: As a Power User, I want to easily access and control my privacy settings, including the ability to customize what information is shared with others, so that I can maintain control over my personal data and online presence.\nUSER STORY: As a Power User, I want to be able to easily switch between languages and translate content in the app, so that I can communicate with users who speak different languages and access content that may not be available in my native language.\n```\n\nThese user stories can be used to guide the development of the app and ensure that the requirements outlined in the user feedback are met.",
        "To create a user story from the given review, let's first identify the main elements:\n\n- **Type of user**: Based on the review, the user is likely an average consumer using the Threads app.\n- **Action wanted**: The user wants to be able to attach media from the camera for spontaneous opportunities and share it in the app.\n- **Goal**: The user can potentially share content in real-time, without needing to find and select content from their gallery.\n\nNow, let's create the user story:\n\nAs a social media user, I want to attach media from my device's camera directly in the app while creating a post, so that I can share spontaneous updates and content in real-time.\n\nUSER STORY: As a social media user, I want to attach media from my device's camera directly in the app while creating a post, so that I can share spontaneous updates and content in real-time.",
        "To create a clear and formally sound user story, let's break down the review and identify the key elements.\n\n1. **Type of user**: The user is an Android app user who has downloaded the Threads app.\n2. **Desired action**: The user wants to use the app without any issues, specifically after connecting it to their Instagram account.\n3. **Goal**: The goal is to use the app smoothly without any bugs or crashes.\n\nNow, let's fill in the template:\n\nAs a **Android app user**, I want **to use the app without any issues or bugs after connecting it to my Instagram account**, so that **I can have a smooth and seamless experience**.\n\nHere is the output in the exact format requested:\n\n```USER STORY: As a Android app user, I want to use the app without any issues or bugs after connecting it to my Instagram account, so that I can have a smooth and seamless experience.```",
        "Based on the review, I'd interpret the user's comment as being cautiously optimistic about using the app. They're not providing any specific feedback about the app's features or functionality, but rather expressing a willingness to use it. This could suggest that the user is expecting the app to meet some basic expectations or needs. \n\nLet's attempt to structure a user story based on this:\n\nThe \"type of user\" is likely to be someone who currently uses social media apps or is interested in trying out a new one. This is a broad category, but for the purpose of creating a user story, we'll focus on a specific type of user - \"As a social media user, I...\"\n\nThe goal of the user story could be \"to use this app\", which seems nonspecific. Let's try to make it more relevant by considering what the user would want to achieve by using the app. \n\nBased on the context of social media and real-time conversations, the goal could be \"to stay connected with others through real-time text-based conversations\".\n\nNow, the \"some goal is met\" part should relate to the achievement of this goal. Since the review doesn't provide explicit information about goals, we can make an educated guess that the goal of staying connected would lead to \"feeling more connected with others\".\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nUSER STORY: As a social media user, I want to be able to use this app for real-time text-based conversations, so that I can feel more connected with others who matter.\n\nThis user story is informal and could use more refinement. However, it should give us a direction in which to focus our requirements engineering efforts to align with the users' needs.",
        "To create a clear and formally sound user story based on the given review, let's analyze the text step by step.\n\n- **Identifying the user type**: The reviewer is a user of the Threads app, so we can assume they are a general consumer or end-user of the application.\n- **Identifying the task**: The reviewer wants to edit a post. To make the story more specific, we'll assume that by \"post,\" they mean any content they share on the app, such as a text update or a photo.\n- **Identifying the goal**: The reviewer wants to edit the post so that they can correct any mistakes or change the content as needed.\n\nUsing this information, we can now create the user story:\n\n**USER STORY:** As a Threads app user, I want to edit content I have shared on the app, so that I can correct errors or change my updates as needed.",
        "To create a user story from the given review, let's identify the key elements:\n\n1. **User Type**: The user is a Thread app user.\n2. **Desired Action**: The user expresses frustration with a specific aspect of the app, which is related to the login process, but doesn't directly ask for a change. However, we can infer their goal.\n3. **Goal**: The user's goal is to avoid being overwhelmed by the integration or promotion of another social media app (Instagram) within the Threads app experience.\n\nGiven these points, the user story can be structured as follows:\n\n```javascript\nAs a sporadic Thread app user, I want to access my account on Threads without experiencing sudden spikes in user numbers that lead to login delays, so that I can have a smooth and consistent experience.\n```\n\nHowever, considering the original review's tone and content, it seems the user is more specifically reacting to the absence of Instagram's integration or promotion as a way to differentiate from a sudden influx of new users and login delays, but this is not directly stated. Therefore, the goal inferred leans more towards stability and consistency in the user experience without sudden increases in demand.\n\nThe original structure does not directly translate to asking for Instagram integration, but the frustration expressed seems to imply a desire for a more stable platform without sudden surges in users.\n\nThus, I provide the following structured user story based on inferred understanding of the problem and goal, aligning with typical usability and quality of service expectations:\n\n```javascript\nUSER STORY: As a consistent Thread app user, I want to experience a stable service with predictable performance, so that I can use the app without unexpected disruptions or delays.\n```",

This implies that the user wants to **claim their preferred username** and **create a profile**.\n3. **Understand the goal**: The user's goal is to **successfully create a profile with their preferred username**, which is a fundamental aspect of using the social media app.\n\nNow, let's fill in the template:\n\nAs a **new user or user trying to set up their account**, I want **to be able to claim my preferred username and create a profile**, so that **I can successfully set up and use my profile on the app**.\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\nUSER STORY: As a new user or user trying to set up their account, I want to be able to claim my preferred username and create a profile, so that I can successfully set up and use my profile on the app.\n```",

The user likely contacted customer support for help, indicating that the system is not effectively providing assistance.\n\nHere's a suggested user story based on this analysis:\n\n**CUSTOMER SUPPORT REQUEST**\n\nUSER STORY: As an active user, I want to receive a clear and actionable error message (\"something went wrong\") that provides resolution options along with links to accessible and knowledgeable customer support, or the ability to refresh and continue using the app, so that I can resolve the issue and continue using Threads to engage with content and interact with the community.\n\nAlternatively, a more user-focused approach could be taken if the goal is solely centering around the user's perspective and not yet including a secondary option of contacting support.\n\n**RESTORED ACCESS**\n\nUSER STORY: As an active user, I want error messages (\"something went wrong\") that restore app functionality if I refresh the app or restart it, so that I can continue posting, commenting, and accessing my profile as expected.",

They mention it's not as good as Twitter and that it will become a \"fake show-off world\" like Instagram.\n\n3. **Determine the goal:** The reviewer's main goal seems to be that the app should offer more genuine or real-world experiences, akin to Twitter, rather than becoming another app like Instagram that focuses on artificial displays of wealth or status.\n\nGiven these points, let's construct the user story.\n\nFirst, we can abstract the reviewer's sentiment: they want an experience that feels more \"real\" or authentic, like Twitter. \n\nNow, let's fill in our template:\n\n```As a [type of user], I want [to do something], so that [some goal is met].```\n\n- **As a** `[type of user]`: A general social media user.\n- **I want** `[to do something]`: I want to use the Threads app in a way that feels authentic and \"real.\"\n- **so that** `[some goal is met]`: so that I can engage in real-world conversations without the app feeling like it is promoting artificial or fake representations of wealth or status.\n\nTherefore, the user story based on the given review, formatted exactly as requested, is:\n\n \"\"\"USER STORY: As a general social media user, I want to use the Threads app in a way that feels authentic and \"real,\" so that I can engage in real-world conversations without the app feeling like it is promoting artificial or fake representations of wealth or status.\"\"\"\n \nThis formulation directly addresses the concern expressed by the reviewer, aiming to capture the essence of their feedback in a clear and actionable manner.",
