"Sucky. Keeps picking up my phone. Clicking download on more devices only brings up my phone, not the tablet , I'm on that I want to download too. Have tried periodically all day."
"Worked fine for the first two days and then suddenly I can't seem to make any kind of post on the evening of the third day. It keeps posting (uploading) foever."
"Been great so far! However I can't seem to reinstate hidden badges on Instagram...is there a way to toggle this function?"
"Making IG account the only option to get on this app isn't a good move.. 👎🏾👎🏾"
"Can not make a 1st time account, it just ask me to sign in using Instagram that I do not have on my phone, SO HOW TO MAKE A ACCOUNT?????"
"It's hard to find anything interesting... all just stars, and I don't care about them."
"Basic features work as expected. But it's about time we get a big update with more complex features like Edit Thread, Translate Thread, Ability to pin Threads, better Feed page, video player optimization and working hastagd. A trending page would be nice too. But current app is very good. 4/5."
"is there a button or feature that let only the accounts that I follow would appear on my feed/wall/page? if not, I hope the devs can add them"
"Overall, it looks clean. Though it would be nice to have a collaborative feature where users can do a space to talk and share ideas in the future. Also, maybe we can have an option to create a separate account for Threads and not require an instagram account."
"This app is awesome but I want one extra feature to chat personal with any person . If the meta team are add this feature. I will greatly thankful for all team of meta."
"Vidéos on my Threads app has not been talking, just watching movements but couldn't hear anything even after trying out different buttons that could help."
"Why my Home Filled with Threads by Verified Account? I dont follow them. Please fix this.. its very disturbing."
"There is some glitch while opening replies section via push notification 😕 its not showing"
"For some reason whenever I try to post a picture threads keep stop working 🤦🏻‍♂️"
"What i want is not there is just basically tweet from accounts i follow on Instagram"
"So far not a big fan. Its alright but my feed is majority people I am not following nor are of any interest to me. Until I only see people I follow on my feed I wont give it any more stars. I dont care about things that dont align with my interests."
"My account gets automatically logged out of Instagram when I sign in for threads nd vice versa, it gets logged out of threads when I use Instagram. How to fix?"
"It's buggy, full of bugs and posting failed continuously, also app crashes on my high end processor phone."
"Terrible functionality with photos, images. Yup, it's Instagram, you can't zoom without autoreset, size and quality are bad, and yeah... you can't download it."
"I'm really loving threads so far. My only suggestions would be to provide having multiple accounts logged in like Instagram does, and some UI customization like themes and colors, maybe headers for our accounts."
