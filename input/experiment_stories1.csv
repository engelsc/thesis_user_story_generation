"Having rendering issue.. the app opens well but the moment I tried to scroll everything collapses ... It like every text overlap with each other.. How to fix it ??"
"Eats your battery like crazy. My battery normally lasts all day and downloaded this and it was almost dead in an hour and I hadn't even used the app properly yet. Checked my settings and it came up that this app was mostly using up the battery. Unusable if an app drains the battery quickly."
"Excited for this one. Ofc being 1st day means some glitches here and there, like the like animation isn't all that intuitive."
"It makes no sense, what's point of this app? I have seen hundreds of better apps than this one"
"An impressive piece of Spyware that's good at circumventing firewalls. Another app you'll want a separate phone for. Aggregate accounts and corporate shills are what ruined Instagram as a platform, and Threads is a celebration of those things. A great app for stalkers and law enforcement in states where abortion and being gay or trans is illegal."
"Anonymity is a right. My secondary account got banned practically as soon as I created it because I used my username as my 'real name', even after verifying myself with a live image. Also, no way to search hashtags or cashtags from what I can tell."
"I hope the security on this app will not be like that of Instagram, easily hacked. Else we will still go back to twitter."
"I'm on Android phone. Why can't I upload a pic to threads? I could yesterday. Now when I try to add a pic, the app just closes."
"Looks very clumsy. Material design sucks. While trying to upload the media, unable to go to a specific folder in gallery app in Android. But works well in iOS. And no option to save images like Twitter. Why that specific option is not copied from Twitter?"
"The app is good and all but why android users can't download pics from the app? Fix it please"
"Great app. Great potential. Great additions would be a following only feed & a DM system that's integrated with messenger & instagram DMs. A better followers & following system is also needed."
"I have a problem with the application, the words stick together and everything sticks together. I want a solution"
"The app was very good,the app also not very laggy but The problem is the Interface make me felling dizzy"
"Threads have more bugs than Instagram.. the list goes on n on.. hope it doesn't becomes another bloatware like ig..."
"I dont know what happened but as soon as I log in into threads, its kind of a bug or something, my screen suddenly starts acting weird and the title and post begins to flicker. I reinstalled it many times but didn't worked. I can't even read a thing."
"Idk why the app closes itself if I search a user then click under post replies"
"Screen scrolling speed very slow. To compare other app, Screen refresh rate very low in this app"
"Nice so far but the keyboard covers my message when I'm in the middle of typing so I can't see what I'm typing."
"I don't understand what's it what type of app this is we can't change our user name or many more think that"
"I accidentally linked my account to it but sadly i can't delete my threads account without deleting my instagram account. Such a trashh app"
