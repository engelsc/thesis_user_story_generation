"It makes no sense, what's point of this app? I have seen hundreds of better apps than this one","As a new Threads user, I want to understand the unique purpose of the app, so that I can determine if it offers more value than other social platforms.",,
"Looks very clumsy. Material design sucks. While trying to upload the media, unable to go to a specific folder in gallery app in Android. But works well in iOS. And no option to save images like Twitter. Why that specific option is not copied from Twitter?","As a Threads user on Android, I want to be able to navigate to a specific folder in my gallery when uploading, so that I can easily find and select the desired images and videos.","As a Threads user on Android, I want the app‚Äôs design to be more intuitive, so that it feels less clumsy.
",
The app is good and all but why android users can't download pics from the app? Fix it please,"As a Threads user on Android, I want to download pictures from the app, so that I can save and access them outside the app.",,
Great app. Great potential. Great additions would be a following only feed & a DM system that's integrated with messenger & instagram DMs. A better followers & following system is also needed.,"As a Threads user, I want a following-only feed, so that I can view posts exclusively from people I follow without additional content from the algorithm.","As a Threads user, I want a direct messaging system integrated with Messenger and Instagram DMs, so that I can communicate seamlessly across Meta‚Äôs platforms without switching apps.","As a Threads user, I want a better followers and following system, so that I can manage and navigate my social connections more effectively."
"I have a problem with the application, the words stick together and everything sticks together. I want a solution","As a Threads user, I want text in posts and messages to be displayed correctly without words sticking together, so that I can read content clearly.",,
Threads have more bugs than Instagram.. the list goes on n on.. hope it doesn't becomes another bloatware like ig...,"As a Threads user, I want the app to be more stable with fewer bugs, so that my experience is smooth and frustration-free.",,
"Screen scrolling speed very slow. To compare other app, Screen refresh rate very low in this app","As a Threads user, I want the scrolling speed to be faster, so that I can navigate through content smoothly.","As a Threads user, I want the screen refresh rate to be higher, so that the app feels more responsive.",
I don't understand what's it what type of app this is we can't change our user name or many more think that,"As a Threads user, I want to be able to change my username, so I can personalize my profile after account creation.",,
I accidentally linked my account to it but sadly i can't delete my threads account without deleting my instagram account. Such a trashh app,"As a Threads user, I want to be able to delete my Threads account without deleting my Instagram account, so that I can use my accounts independently.",,
"Sucky. Keeps picking up my phone. Clicking download on more devices only brings up my phone, not the tablet , I'm on that I want to download too. Have tried periodically all day.","As a Threads user, I want to be able to download and install the app on any device, so I can use it on my preffered devices without issue.",,
Been great so far! However I can't seem to reinstate hidden badges on Instagram...is there a way to toggle this function?,"As a Threads user, I want to be able to toggle hidden badges on Instagram, so that I can manage my visibility settings as needed.",,
Making IG account the only option to get on this app isn't a good move.. üëéüèæüëéüèæ,"As a Threads user, I want to be able to use the app without an Instagram account, so that I do not need to create an account for a service I do not use.",,
"Basic features work as expected. But it's about time we get a big update with more complex features like Edit Thread, Translate Thread, Ability to pin Threads, better Feed page, video player optimization and working hastagd. A trending page would be nice too. But current app is very good. 4/5.","As a Threads user, I want to edit my Threads after posting, so that I can correct mistakes and update content.","As a Threads user, I want to be able to automatically translate posts, so that I can understand and engage with content in different languages.","As a Threads user, I want hashtags to function properly, so that I can explore and categorize content effectively."
"is there a button or feature that let only the accounts that I follow would appear on my feed/wall/page? if not, I hope the devs can add them","As a Threads user, I want to filter my feed to show only posts from accounts I follow, so that I can see content that is relevant to me without unwanted posts.",,
This app is awesome but I want one extra feature to chat personal with any person . If the meta team are add this feature. I will greatly thankful for all team of meta.,"As a Threads user, I want to have a private chat feature, so that I can directly communicate with any person.",,
Why my Home Filled with Threads by Verified Account? I dont follow them. Please fix this.. its very disturbing.,"As a Threads user, I want to only see posts from people I follow, so that I am not disturbed by verified accounts I did not choose to follow.",,
For some reason whenever I try to post a picture threads keep stop working ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,"As a Threads user, I want to post a picture without the app crashing, so that I can share content without interruptions.",,
So far not a big fan. Its alright but my feed is majority people I am not following nor are of any interest to me. Until I only see people I follow on my feed I wont give it any more stars. I dont care about things that dont align with my interests.,"As a Threads user, I want to see only content from people I follow in my feed, so that my feed aligns with my interests.",,
"My account gets automatically logged out of Instagram when I sign in for threads nd vice versa, it gets logged out of threads when I use Instagram. How to fix?","As a Threads user, I want to stay logged into both Threads and Instagram when switching between them, so that I don‚Äôt have to repeadedly sign in.",,
"It's buggy, full of bugs and posting failed continuously, also app crashes on my high end processor phone.","As a Threads user, I want to use the app without crashes on my high end device, so that I can use it reliably without interruptions.",,
"They need to add a DM button, saving a picture button, also people should be able to change their Threads username withiut changing that of Instagram and the profile picture too.",,,
"Very cool rn, but would like to see who I'm following on threads as well as topic searches opposed to profile only in the search section",,,
The restriction messages are annoying and once they start you won't follow people successfully even when you are logged in. You follow on your endand the person is not followed on the other end,,,
GUI of app is very neat and attractive in the term of simplicity. Loved it... Suggestions: 1. There should be unread thread badge... 2. Unread Threads should be viewed by scrolling down... 3. Translation for all languages should be made available... 4. Top trending threads in the term of hashtags should displayed...,,,
After a sec of looking around I finally understand the app. You write and thread and people comment and interact with them. You link your Instagram to the app and you have your account. Try it out!,,,
"No point using since I can't customise what I see on my feed. I don't want to see all the possible posts from the multi-verse, only from who I follow. I have zero interest in sports, don't follow anybody in sports, so that showing up is an instant uninstall.",,,
"90% of my home feed is ads or blue-check-marks posting trash I don't want to see or people I don't care about. For some reason, the other 10% is Spanish and I don't even speak Spanish!!?? I scrolled through today for 10 minutes and didn't see a SINGLE ACCOUNT I FOLLOWED.",,,
I'm rating 4 stars. The app itself is not so good for use but it has built a large community. May be in future they introduce all the other features. Right now there are so few things to do here. But I hope it will become better than other platforms.,,,
"I am experiencing a problem with video sounds. If the audio is muted video plays fine. When I turn the audio on, video stops playing. Both in feed and when I click on video and open it, it happens.",,,
"Totally insane You have no freedom of expression on Threads like other Meta products, also leaks user data. Very Bad Not recommended",,,
"It was working perfectly but all of a sudden it's like glitching I don't know what is the matter, anyone who has an idea on how to fix it just assist me coz this app is supper great I have expirienced it",,,
Glitches are there in Home feed I do understand it got launched right now but will take some time to make it better All the best team,,,
"You should make this app available for Iphones worldwide as well, and make sure you add the switch account option just like in instagram to make it easier to manage two accounts at the same time.",,,
"The app was very good,the app also not very laggy but The problem is the Interface make me felling dizzy","As a Threads user, I want the app interface to not  stutter, so that I can use the app without feeling dizzy. ",,
"That's a very good app, very reliable and very easy to use, I highly recommend it",,,
"It's a great step, but I wish it was more convenient. Placing the comment and like button in accordance to your hand as I am a right handed I would like them on the right side. Double tap on like also needed.",,,
"User experience is very good compared to Twitter, but some features are missing, for example I can't on my profile people I m following, and I also can't see others following list, hope this feature will arrive soon, and the logo of the app is not looking professional. Hope they don't add promoted content too much, like Twitter.",,,
This is tiktok but in form of a cheap ripoff of twitter. Recommendations are basically OF girls twerking trying to keep horny men on this platform.,,,
"Overall, it looks clean. Though it would be nice to have a collaborative feature where users can do a space to talk and share ideas in the future. Also, maybe we can have an option to create a separate account for Threads and not require an instagram account.",,,
The volume of videos is automatically muted. Hope this problem will be fixed very soon.,,,
It not proper working my location are in other places showing in my Instagram app.,,,
Good younger app from metta but will be famous more then Twitter..thank you metta genius gentleman Mr Mark.,,,
"It won't even let me in when I go into the app, it wants me to enter an 8 digit number backup code, and it sends a text with a 6 digit code, so I can't even get past that screen.",,,
Very bad experience üòï all texts are shaking. At first fixed the problem and then realise again üò§,,,
Could really use a feed just for accounts I'm following. Would also be nice to have themed icon support for Android 13+.,,,
Worked fine for the first two days and then suddenly I can't seem to make any kind of post on the evening of the third day. It keeps posting (uploading) foever.,"As a Threads user, I want to be able to post without indefinite uploading, so that I can share my thoughts in real-time.",,
"I love thisüòç, no adsüòç yet but I'm sure they won't be longüòû. Really easy to use üòé",,,
First of all it's great tbh of course it needs some work to be done but it's very new and u can report anything and they fix it fast how far it goes for me as a new app it's amazing,,,
"I'm really loving threads so far. My only suggestions would be to provide having multiple accounts logged in like Instagram does, and some UI customization like themes and colors, maybe headers for our accounts.","As aThreads user, I want to be able to log into multiple accounts simultaneously, so that I can easily switch between different profiles without logging out.","As a Threads user, I want to customize the app‚Äôs appearance with themes and colors, so that I can personalize my experience and improve visual comfort.","As a Threads user, I want to add a custom header to my account, so that I can personalize my profile and make it more visually appealing."
"An impressive piece of Spyware that's good at circumventing firewalls. Another app you'll want a separate phone for. Aggregate accounts and corporate shills are what ruined Instagram as a platform, and Threads is a celebration of those things. A great app for stalkers and law enforcement in states where abortion and being gay or trans is illegal.",,,
"I want to read stuff only from people I follow, not some random bs from random strangers.",,,
"1 - we can't delete our account in this without deleting out insta account 2 - Even after removing the number badge on my insta profile several times, it keeps coming back.",,,
"I have major issues logging in, whenever I switch it Instagram I instantly get logged out saying that the user might have changed the password when the password remains the same. The same thing happens when I open the threads app. Has a lot of potential otherwise. The app continuously keeps crashing as well as Instagram",,,
I think the #thread is not different from Instagram so it is a waste of time to use it üôÑ #IrfanAli,,,
"After using this app, my account in Instagram keeps crashing, but when i use another account it's fine, ig its because that account is connected to threads, please fix it!!",,,
In this app we don't have any choice to edit anything about profile! That's not goodüëéüèæ,,,
It doesn't open whatever I try I don't know where is the problem I tried to delete and istall it again many times but there's always a flaw I hope it will be fixed soon,,,
"I cannot post photos with videos and cannot post single video or reply with videos. Always failed, please fix ASAP",,,
This app has a lot of potential and there's definitely some room for improvement. I just wish on the next update they would add the dark mode thingie,,,
I think I'm the very first person to right this review...because I can't find any reviews yet lol...But I loved it ..threads ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èthis is something amazing and fun to use.. Thank you Metaüî•üî•,,,
"I hope they add stories and messages to it, honestly make threads its own app.",,,
Ok so far. But why am I seeing threads from people that I'm not following/ nor have any interest in? This app won't last long if that doesn't change,,,
"This app is so disgusting because there are no girls in this app, it's full of white skinned bulls and I follow 2000 people but no one follow me..very unsatisfied mark.",,,
When i open the app the gets glitch... When i scroll down or up it gets overlap one after another plz resolve...,,,
What a mess. I only want to see people I follow. I don't care what the other nuffies are up to. You hide the feature in Instagram and on Threads it isn't even an option. Another garbage app from out of touch devs.,,,
"A lot better and its just a start of Threads, they're gonna improve it more, just stay tuned",,,
What i want is not there is just basically tweet from accounts i follow on Instagram,"As a Threads user, I want to see content from more than just people I follow on Instagram, so that I can access a wider variety of content.",,
"Definitely has potential, but there's a lot showing up on my thread that is not interesting to me at all. Need to work on the algorithm a bit or allow me only to view my followed accounts",,,
Having rendering issue.. the app opens well but the moment I tried to scroll everything collapses ... It like every text overlap with each other.. How to fix it ??,"As a mobile Threads user, I want the text to render properly while scrolling, so that I can read content without overlapping or display issues.",,
Eats your battery like crazy. My battery normally lasts all day and downloaded this and it was almost dead in an hour and I hadn't even used the app properly yet. Checked my settings and it came up that this app was mostly using up the battery. Unusable if an app drains the battery quickly.,,,
"Very barebones at the moment. It has lots of potential though, hopefully they don't screw it up",,,
It merges the aesthetics of Instagram and the functionalities essential and more than enough for microblogging. It's a match made in heaven.,,,
App is very unstable. The words in an entire screen mesh in the worse way possible once I scroll down through the threads. Can't even read anything,,,
WHY do I have to log in thru IG? I don't like that. Need to be able to login solely thru Threads@,,,
"Very bad experience having till now . Not able to scroll the window it's lagg a lot , please go further and help me out",,,
Idk why the app closes itself if I search a user then click under post replies,"As a Threads user, I want the app to remain stable when I search for a user and click on post replies, so that I can browse conversations without unexpected crashes.",,
"Bad thing is that if we delete or deactivate th thread app, automatically instagram will deactivate üëéüëé",,,
"In this Lost of Amazing feature , new Experience for us . In short, Outclass üòç @threadsapp",,,
"Can not make a 1st time account, it just ask me to sign in using Instagram that I do not have on my phone, SO HOW TO MAKE A ACCOUNT?????","As a Threads user, I want to create a Threads account without requiring Instagram, so that I can access and use the app independently.",,
"App is trash, created an account and it got immediately suspended. Not even worth the effort to try to fix, just uninstalling.",,,
"Good app, good beginning...needs lot of improvement and I believe this app will emerge as one of the best app in social media world. Follow my threads account @kamriakhanam",,,
Interface was not that good. Slow and many features are needed. I'll give it some time considering this is new,,,
"I hope the security on this app will not be like that of Instagram, easily hacked. Else we will still go back to twitter.","As a security conscious Threads user, I want the app to have strong security measures, so that my account is not easily hacked.",,
"Right now, it's a void. Very little of what you actually want to see shows up, and the rest is noise from bigger accounts (verified army) and ads. We'll see what it becomes eventually (your following does creep through every now and then, but not nearly enough). I do think the UI is clean though.",,,
"It's hard to find anything interesting... all just stars, and I don't care about them.",,,
"Great little side ""app"" to extend the features of Instagram, it incorporates similar page styles to Reddit although not all that comprehensive it gives a streamlined approach to the usual ""doom scrolling"" I've seen on other social media platforms.",,,
overall good but crashes on honor phones if you try to @ someone directly.. edit: app keeps crashing seemingly randomly not just when you try @ing someone,,,
"I'm on Android phone. Why can't I upload a pic to threads? I could yesterday. Now when I try to add a pic, the app just closes.","As a Threads user on Android, I want the app to remain stable when I upload a picture, so that I can use the feature without crashes.",,
Terrible! I scroll and all text and images leave trails and it just stuck there!,,,
It doesn't work correctly there's a glitch at the home bage of the app so i cant use it at all becouse of this glitch,,,
I can't scroll down the notification bar where I can confirm the follow requests from my friends.,,,
Thank u so much zucki uncle for inventing another app now we will Waste our time on thread as well üòâ,,,
"Frustrating! I don't have, and don't want, an Instagram account, so I can't use the App...",,,
Well something Interesting after a long time for starters it is basically Instagram with some add on's,,,
3rd class copy of twitter...you just have people on instagram thats why it got famous or else as a thread alone app is not worth it...,,,
"This application collect many types of data collected from users like that personal info, financial side, shopping activities and device id",,,
Even shorter vidios not getting uploaded. Very slow working. Need to go a very long way to compete with Tweeter.,,,
"The app doesn't work for me, the screen flashes and has errors, my phone is the Redmi Note 6 Pro, it's an old phone but it should be compatible :c",,,
Can't even use the app because I keep getting an error message when trying to login.,,,
"Overall a nice application, feels like something fresh in the market but this definitely needs some brand new things that would make it unique compared to other platforms üêí",,,
Threads is a very user-friendly app. All that I don't like is that the app doesn't manually allow you to change it to dark mode.,,,
There is some glitch while opening replies section via push notification üòï its not showing,,,
"Wish there was a dm section though. ANNND, save option for pictures (kudos to the high resolution)",,,
"Terrible functionality with photos, images. Yup, it's Instagram, you can't zoom without autoreset, size and quality are bad, and yeah... you can't download it.",,,
Does not have hash tag search option. You can't search trending hashtag. Trending hashtag must be there.. Poor Copy of twitter.,,,
"Everything is good in this app, but when I'm trying to upload pic, it crashes. I don't why it's happening I uninstall it and install it many times but the problem remain same",,,
Very poor nothing new on it still Twiter much better and far away from this app.. I think there must be a new and smart concept to attract users.,,,
I logged out to try and make an alt account but now it won't let me back in at all and it's keeps crashing. Also I'd liked my following feed to take priority over randos please and thanks,,,
"Much comfortable to post and much simple and minimalist design, great app and i hope it updates more features",,,
How do we see threads from only people we Follow and not from everyone we don't follow?,,,
Security detected this app attempting to access my banking apps. CORRUPT and UNSAFE app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!,,,
"The app is lagging too much i can't even see my profile,go to the settings or see followers and anything. Maybe it's because the app is still new but i hope this problem will be solved soon",,,
"Can't search for users Have to scroll all the way up to refresh, no pull down to refresh. Have to click multiple times to see reply to a reply. Didn't get get any activity from followers on my post. Unclear if they are inactive or not seeing my posts.",,,
"Only Instagram option for sign in. If this is essentially a thread adaption FOR Insta, why make its own app. Wont be using this if i have to make an account for a social I don't utilize. Add another sign in method.",,,
"The only option I had was to sign in with an Instagram account, which I don't have. Sorry.",,,
Nice app but I need to easily see threads from just the people I follow like on Instagram. Don't need AI to tell me what I like.,,,
Plz give an option to switch like Instagram why always need to log out it's irritating üôÑ,,,
"Anonymity is a right. My secondary account got banned practically as soon as I created it because I used my username as my ""real name"", even after verifying myself with a live image. Also, no way to search hashtags or cashtags from what I can tell.","As a privacy-conscious user, I want to use a secondary account with a chosen username as my real name, so that I can maintain my anonymity while using the app.","As an engaged user, I want to search for hashtags or cashtags, so that I can easily discover relevant content and discussions.",
"It's a trap! Once you create a Threads profile, the only way to delete it is to also delete your Instagram account üò°",,,
"This app is amazing! It could use features like GIFs and live streaming. Unlike Twitter, the tweets aren't repetitive and you can easily see everyone's threads. It's making it so much easier to connect with new people.",,,
"It was quite good. I really love the app, it helps me gain audience to my Instagram also",,,
"It gives you the option to follow people, but your feed will continue to display any post from any user on the platform making following people completely pointless",,,
"No dark mode, no cronological order mode, no desktop version, no only followers mode, probably the worse meta app yet, worse than facebook.",,,
"Cool idea in theory, but uninstalling until I can have a home page of only accounts I follow and view posts in chronological order. That's all I want from an app like this.",,,
Gathers a ton of unnecessary data + can't delete account without deleting your insta account.,,,
It has lot bugs and it is lagging and it should be fix right now,,,
Nice so far but the keyboard covers my message when I'm in the middle of typing so I can't see what I'm typing.,,,
The app is crashing i sent 1 star if the bug has been fix I'll change it to 5 star,,,
"I mean we just got here so I'm not expecting the world, however, seeing that we're going from Instagram straight to Threads, I'm disappointed to see that I can't seamlessly switch between my accounts on Threads like I can on Instagram.",,,
"i love it so far, although my only problem is that i can't see who i already followed back and who i haven't. but so far so good, feels like a safe space for everyone that needs a social media to be free from toxic people",,,
"You cannot delete your thread account. If you did, it will also delete Instagram account.",,,
"Review From Hyderabad, India üáÆüá≥ Awesome App, Thanks for Retaining Verified Badge From Instagram, I will Update Again my Review on this App After Using Many Days.",,,
"A complete mess on screen as it's not refreshing correctly on my Android phone (v9), so until that's fixed, it's unusable",,,
When I try to attach a picture with my threads the app suddenly closes... Can you plz fix this ....,,,
You have to use same username that is on Instagram. I am already not happy with the username there and now I have to stick the same username with here so that is my major issue..,,,
"I'm getting notifications from 2 days ago, not most recent. I would like to be able to sort my feed to only people I follow.",,,
"There is a issue when I tried to login with my Instagram credentials. Even though giving correct id and password I am unable to login in my android device over and over. Hope that alternate login system eg: forgot password, send OTP etc. will be added soon. This info might help: Device Name: Samsung Galaxy A10 Android Version: 11",,,
My only disappointment so far is not being able to use gifs when leaving a comment on a post. Awkward introverts need a way to communicate without words when brain stops working,,,
"You can't create account you need Instagram account to create account, 99% who interested in cripto don't have Instagram",,,
Just downloaded and it's already having issues posts won't load doesn't let me like or reply,,,
Whenever i log into threads my insta shows a notification that an unknown device has logged into my insta far from my location,,,
"Excited for this one. Ofc being 1st day means some glitches here and there, like the like animation isn't all that intuitive.",,,
"A little nitpick but my phone settings literally does not have a dark mode option. Please put it in the app, thanks.",,,
This Applications interface is shuttering when I use to refresh the page and also it don't responded as I can expect. I thing it needs to improve their interfacen !! Yes I was very excited to use this app but it didn't work in my phone. Is it running fine with your device ?,,,
I really like the app but I wish they could put an option where you can delete your account without involving your actual Instagram account. It's really a hassle.,,,
Tried to use. Can't create account without Instagram. I uninstalled threads. You can't force me to use an app I don't want to use.,,,
Why don't you give us an option where we can see the posts of people only we follow and not n number of random meaningless stuff in which we are not interested at all?,,,
"It's gd, I just didn't like the fact that celebrities brought their followers and now looks exactly like Instagram",,,
Was beginning to enjoy it until I started constantly seeing post by someone I'm not even friends with. Literally every four posts there they are. It's not my page it's their page now I'll check back in on it sometime in the future when more friends are on,,,
"Really nice apps, it's free service will skyrocket in popularity, I urge you to update the system constantly to make it better, and best of luck..!üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,

"Dont download this app if you want to let your instagram work properly, as I have downloaded this app and started my profile with the same username as in my insta. But after 24 hours my insta app start getting CRASH , However when I logged in with different account on my insta app it works properly.",,,
"Facing some issues such as the app eventually getting closed. Issues while writing captions, app getting closed on its own because videos are posted and so on.",,,
"Some problem are there the moment I log in there I thought it normal when I scroll down for the first time it was lagging like anything letters were floating , I think right now we can't use it properly but i think you guys will fix it nicely.... Thank you",,,
"It's quite easy to use without any complications. I would say this app is the best as a replacement of Twitter, that's for sure.",,,
"Off to a good start. Instagram integration is excellent. Desperately needs a ""only people I follow"" feed though.",,,
error in log-in? I'm not even log out my account. What is happening? there is other account which is changing my password? Like? seriously?,,,
Great app... But I don't really see the point of including media attachments when you already have Instagram. Keep this text-based only.,,,
"I know it's a new app but it's missing many features, e.g when you're selecting images it doesn't give you an option to select by folder or group name If the pic you want to post is an old pic, you'll have to scroll till infinity to find itüòíüíî",,,
I don't want a threads account but I want an Instagram account...why do I have to have both? :(,,,

"Sorry to here there is no windows app for the new Instagram Threads app. Also you are unable to log into the site on a windows computer, tablet or laptop.",,,
It should be having a personal messaging feature also.. I totally loved this app and it's just fab üòç Just the above mentioned update can make it perfect üòÉ,,,
fix your app asap. it glitches so bad itll cause epilepsy. i also dm'd this on insta to threadsapp. so you better answer that to see how bad it glitches(acc: dem0s.privv502),,,
Boring walls of text from people I've never heard of. The app has no apparent purpose. Uninstalled.,,,
"Quick, yes. I will need to be able to curate my feed at some point, but this initial flood of content is a goldmine for businesses! Threads Links from other apps (WhatsApp) don't open to the app. Rather, they open in Chrome! Loss of traffic.",,,
"It's okeh but bruv, if u wanna compleat add story & ig music with reels too, Incld adding hash tags & music to photos, it would work so much better like fr, don't have any other problems tho, also messaging people too yk, Cos it's kinda hard to use ngl.",,,
"Need to have an Instagram account which I don't have and no option make make an account for just this, so I gave up and uninstalled immediately.",,,
Just add feature to download images & turn night mode on/off in the app itself.,,,
"Thread: The future of social networking is here! With its sleek design, seamless navigation, and innovative features, Thread has set a new standard. Connect, share, and engage like never before. Get ready to be hooked! #ThreadApp #GameChanger",,,
Great app but add an option to create account without Instagram. I like threads but I hate using Instagram.,,,
"Works alright, has some flaws. Similar to the bird app run by the insane guy. Really needs a dark mode, the white screen is giving me a headache.",,,
i think the app is a great start! one of the things that will be required in order to give space to fan accounts though is to have us be able to easily switch accounts in Threads. You can only sign in/sign out every time - we can't do it smoothly.,,,

"Bad experience as usual and unfair, they simply denied to publish my 1st ever post ""Palestine_is_Arab"". What a garbage community app!!!",,,
"This app is not safe, it's literally letting me see people's phone numbers!!! You're being exposed!!!!",,,
"It's not working at all it's completely broken, when I scroll the text lines up like a windows error bar in a PC. The app is completely broken dude",,,
When I first download it worked perfectly fine but now all the articles are merging on top of each other every time I open the app. This glitch is so bad that I can't use it at all.,,,
"I know it's because it's new .....but there is a lot of glitch ....when swiping down it's not refreshing, automatically showing posting something new , closing the app randomly, and p.s also add a new feature where you can only see stuff from people who you follows",,,
"Koo is much better as twi alternative, Instead of developing it you should take over Koo app.",,,
"I'll be the first to write a review. Not bad, a little rough around the edges, but we'll see how it develops with time. Note: Don't try and delete your profile. You will also trash your IG account.",,,
"Similar to Twitter, but 1- No option to create new account (just connect with insta) üëé 2- Cannot delete threads account without deleting Insta Account. üëé 3- No Hashtags üëé 4- No trending Stories üëé 5- No Chat /Personal Messages section üëé Simply going to uninstall threads. Bye bye üëã",,,
It sucks tbh. Logged in here using one of my Instagram account idk why that account isn't working anymore.,,,
"I dont know what happened but as soon as I log in into threads, its kind of a bug or something, my screen suddenly starts acting weird and the title and post begins to flicker. I reinstalled it many times but didn't worked. I can't even read a thing.",,,
I downloaded the app but the only way to use it is to log into an Instagram account. It doesn't look like I'll be using this until that is changed.,,,
"Not what I expected.. with that being said I was informed if I delete the app my Instagram gets deleted as well. Why would you do that.. not a fan of it, it's complicated if you ask me. Disappointing",,,
There's still a lot to fix in this app. The unnecessary restrictions are just too much and it's making the app look a lot like a child's play...,,,
Not worth switching from other social media. File upload is a fail and the setup is a disaster. I will change my review if you make this app usable.,,,
I feel that the app coukd be better like having a way to show me threads by the people I follow not just one chaotic mess of tweets and replies but I have hope this will evolve into something brilliant its definitely been a long time coming thank you,,,
It's nice. The idea is good but why can't we delete our accounts without deleting our Instagram accounts? Why is there no DM yet? No trend table? Voice threads? A lot has to be done but let's give you guys time,,,
"off to a great start. Obviously it's never gonna be a 5* app upon release, but so far my only gripe is that features which are planned for inclusion aren't there yet. Look forward to when this becomes a more rounded, 'complete' software product. Also, ability to save images would be nice.",,,
Was looking for a new Social media app and found it. It's the best app ever,,,
"Best Experience so far on social media!! Pls help me on this one. When I post a video, I don't get any audio on it. Pls help",,,
Should able to edit an thread likely add an feature to edit or add more option to posting threads. (Cant add gif / hashtags on the 'threads' ),,,
JFC SHOW THE LATEST NOT THE CURATEST. The app is good but stop assuming my news feed. Do better,,,
