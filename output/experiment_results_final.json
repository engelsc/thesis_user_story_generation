			"Here are the minimal set of user stories that capture all the requirements expressed in these reviews:\n\n1. The app should render content without overlap and allow for smooth scrolling in various situations.\n\n2. The app should not consume excessive battery life and provide users with clear battery information in their device settings.\n\n3. The app should have an intuitive design and user experience, avoiding irrelevant or unclear animations and features.\n\n4. The app should respect users' anonymity and maintain secure, prevent potential hacking into user accounts.\n\n5. The app should provide features such as hashtag search and hashtag hashtag caching functionality so users can quickly search for and access content related to their interests.\n\n6. The user interface of the app should work similarly across different platforms (iOS and Android), with all functionalities consistent everywhere.\n\n7. The app should be able to upload and download images to and from a user's existing picture galleries. The functionality to upload and download images should work as well as on twitter and support device dependent operations efficiently.\n\n8. Users should be able to search and find other users from within the android device using advanced search options with location-based services and hashtags filtering enabled by default.\n\n9. An incorporated feed, built to help the users only see the posts from their selected group of individuals only or persons you may following on other apps which you are interested in or else on following and an enhanced profile related interaction tool.\n10. Fix: Words should not stick together on the app interface to enhance a single-page or tab experience with single-task operations for a better end user satisfaction and interaction without distraction for such unnecessary operation execution in user applications\n11. Fix: Application refresh should not make a user's operating device go over or hang during login to make it more comfortable, seamless user experience using latest standards rather making hang often. \n12. The app should have better functionality such as better page load performance enhancements while switching quickly from post replies with quick search options and reduced lags, \n13. Quick read & scanable screen should allow us to have faster refresh rates when moving or switching rapidly across and search new updates including updates that get newly added, to make more efficiency using best UI.\n\n14. Maintain simple interaction layout so the app provides clear keyboard layout and provide necessary messages display so as the messages without unnecessary disruption after posting any information within the application.\n15. Remove user limitation by incorporating account deleting securely (keeping cross-linked data), letting users easily change their names securely as they desire on all new available fields such that no restriction, more accessible features, and free decision.\n16. Proper integration so bug such that caused my user name cover by some kind of strange keyboard not available, due to previous accidental merge but for easy deleting purpose allow for more security and efficiency while adding no bugs using standard framework before further making successful development in long-term for new features."
